# Flask Olympics

Hey Team, here is a post by one of our recent graduates who's now working: http://www.acodingodyssey.com/2016/09/01/guest-post-week-5-of-the-job/

One important thing he noted was that Dojo students don't get enough face-time working with _other_ people's code, which is pretty much _all_ you'll be doing post graduation as a junior developer! As an agile company, we decided to put an end to that immediately; the Flask Olympics torch was ignited!

The goal of today's olympics is to analyze broken flask files! You should be able to see the file tree, and the templates and the server as well as any other files that might be required and determine _whether_ you'll get an error or proper rendering/response!

**THIS IS A GROUP ASSIGNMENT**

Work in groups, and when you submit, be sure to identify which people worked together. 

**I REPEAT, THIS IS A GROUP ASSIGNMENT**

Good Luck!
